h1. Loving-Layouts

Here's a bunch of helpers I find myself needing every time I start up a new Rails project.  Mostly, it's just some nicer DSL wrappers around the @content_for@ patterns we all use to get get content up from the view to the layout in a Rails application (for titles, etc).

h2. And a neat trick for the @<body>@ tag

A block helper for creating body tags is also in there.  The @id@ is generated from @params[:controller]@ (eg "posts"), and the @class@ is generated from @params[:controller]@ name and @params[:action]@ (eg "posts show").

<pre>
  <% body do %>
    ...
  <% end %>
</pre>

Which pushes out something like this:

<pre>
  <body id="posts" class="posts show">
    ...
  </body>
</pre>

You can set the @id@ and @class@ from your views:

<pre>
  <% body_id "blog" %>
  <% body_class "whatever" %>
</pre>

You can override the @id@ and @class@ (or any attribute of the @<body>@ tag) too:

<pre>
  <% body :id => "blog", :class => "whatever", :onload => "party()" do %>
    ...
  <% end %>
</pre>

h2. There's always a TODO List

* might write some tests!
* probably try to distill the way I do tabs too


h2. Blah blah blah blah
